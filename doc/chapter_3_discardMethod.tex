\chapter{Discarded Method}
\label{sec:Discarded Method}
\section{Description}
This chapter covers the methods tried but not included in the end result,
becasue they showed dissatisfactory results. This chapter is also organized
like Chapter~\ref{2-sec:Method}, but for component description please refer to
the before mentioned chapter.

\section{Text Segmentation}
\section{Preprocessing}
\subsection{Find rotation}

  \textbf{Approach: Hough Transform} \\
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hough_transform}{Hough transform} is a
  well known algorithm which finds lines, its approach is to see if it can
  alligne some threshold of pixels on one straight line. To help with this
  process we will do a simple edge detection (Canny) algorithm on the image
  before running it through the Hough Transform. \par
  We discarded this approach because we would end up with lines where there
  were no apperant reason for it to be, and because the approach mentioned
  earlier, cv.minAreaRect() had a satisfactory result.
