	abstract = {My project aims at detecting text segments in an image of a natural scene, by using an enhanced version of the Stroke Width Transform [1]. The application receives an {RGB} image to search in, and returns a new image where the discovered text segments are marked. Due to the features of the {SWT}, the resulting system is able to detect text regardless of its scale, direction, font and language.},

	abstract = {We present a novel image operator that seeks to find the value of stroke width for each image pixel, and demonstrate its use on the task of text detection in natural images. The suggested operator is local and data dependent, which makes it fast and robust enough to eliminate the need for multi-scale computation or scanning windows. Extensive testing shows that the suggested scheme outperforms the latest published algorithms. Its simplicity allows the algorithm to detect texts in many fonts and languages.},
