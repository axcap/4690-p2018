\section{Ambition vs reality?}
Our ambition was relativly ambitious compared to the end product. We envisioned
a software which was rotation invarient, light intensity invarient to some
extend; could recognize text with great accuracy. However, it was a far more
challenging task then we expected. \par
Firstly we started off with a MLP network, which is not the best choice for
image classification. Secondly we didint have too much experience with
machinelearning software, so most of our solutions where a combination of
patching existing code and researching what could give a good result for
our problems.
