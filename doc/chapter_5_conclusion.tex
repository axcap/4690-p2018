\section{Ambition vs reality?}
Our ambition was relatively ambitious compared to the end product. We envisioned
a software which was rotation invariant, light intensity invariant to some
extend; could recognize text with great accuracy. However, it was a far more
challenging task then what we expected. \par
Firstly we started off with a MLP network, which is not the best choice for
image classification. Secondly we didn't have much experience with
machinelearning software, so most of our solutions were a combination of
patching existing code and researching what could give a good result for
our problems. Additionally, as writing everything in the python environment
would be very slow, we decided to write the machinlearning algorithms with the
TensorFlow API. This too was a challange, as it takes some time to understand
how everything in the TensorFlow environment works.
