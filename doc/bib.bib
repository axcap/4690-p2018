The real-time performance is achieved by posing the character detection problem as an efÔ¨Åcient sequential selection from the set of Extremal Regions ({ERs}). The {ER} detector is robust to blur, illumination, color and texture variation and handles lowcontrast text.},

	title = {Stroke Width Transform},
	url = {https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/stroke-width-transform/},
	abstract = {We present a novel image operator that seeks to find the value of stroke width for each image pixel, and demonstrate its use on the task of text detection in natural images. The suggested operator is local and data dependent, which makes it fast and robust enough to eliminate the need for multi-scale computation or scanning windows. Extensive testing shows that the suggested scheme outperforms the latest published algorithms. Its simplicity allows the algorithm to detect texts in many fonts and languages.},
